## ¿Why Quick-i18n is quick?
Quick-18n is a radical approach that allows a quick internationalization of websites not designed for internationalization by just adding a cookie and a dictionary (a js file) for each new language. The key is using the actual language as the base for the translations to other language.

## ¿How it works?
Quick-i18n replaces every single text node using the actual languaje as key. It replaces phrases and long paragraphs. Also, it can replace the value of the attributes passed as parameters.

Quick-i18n is an original idea of Johann Paul Echavarria Zapata ( <a href="https://twitter.com/abrupto" >@abrupto</a> ) with the help of: Alvaro José Agamez Licha (<a href="https://twitter.com/codemaxter" >@codemaxter</a>) and Juan Carlos Gonzalez Arroyave.
